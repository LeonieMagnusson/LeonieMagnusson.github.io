A generalist with a focus on design, teaching, and programming, I enjoy collaborating with people and solving problems through both creative and practical approaches. Working as a designer allows me to combine these skills effectively.

Learning new things through hands-on experience is something I value, and I‚Äôm always open to picking up new skills.
