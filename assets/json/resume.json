I set up a new workflow with the product owner, utilizing GitHub Issues as an issue handling system with a board to effectively track our work. My tasks included modifying layouts, fixing bugs, implementing new features, and cleaning up the codebase. I created a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automatic deployment of the website upon changes and developed comprehensive documentation for setting up the workspace environment and for routine tasks. The environment ran locally in a Docker container, and I worked with PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Additionally, I implemented code linting to ensure code quality.<br><br>What I particularly enjoyed about this role was acting as a detective to solve various challenges, as much of the work was new to me and I didnâ€™t have colleagues to turn to for assistance. I researched solutions online and utilized ChatGPT to help me navigate and resolve issues. It was rewarding to see how I could leverage both my design skills and my logical problem-solving abilities to tackle programming tasks and fix bugs.","highlights":["WordPress","UI/UX","PHP","JavaScript","CSS","HTML","Git","GitHub","CI/CD","Docker","Visual Studio Code","Terminal"]},{"name":"Purple Lantern Games","company":"Purple Lantern Games","position":"Founder, Designer & Illustrator","startDate":"2021-11","location":"Gothenburg, Sweden","highlights":[]},{"name":"KonstkÃ¥ren, University of Gothenburg","company":"University of Gothenburg","position":"Chairperson","startDate":"2022-06","endDate":"2023-06","location":"Gothenburg, Sweden","highlights":[]},{"name":"Albert","company":"Albert","position":"Design Intern","startDate":"2021-09","endDate":"2021-12","location":"Gothenburg, Sweden","highlights":[]},{"name":"AranÃ¤sgymnasiet and Elof LindÃ¤lvs Gymnasium","company":"Kungsbacka Kommun","position":"Substitute Teacher of German","startDate":"2021-02","endDate":"2021-06","location":"Kungsbacka, Sweden","summary":"I taught two classes of German: an introductory level and a medium level for high school students.
