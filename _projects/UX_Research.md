The Requirements and User Experience course I completed
over a three-month period taught me skills in the field
of UX design. I gained insights in creating testable UX
prototypes using Figma, conducting scientific testing and
interviews with potential users, and studying commonly
used design patterns. In addition, I acquired various modeling
and creativity techniques to enhance my design
process. I also learned the importance of timing and how it
can help to evaluate the effectiveness of a UI/UX design.

During the course, my group and I developed a concept for
an imaginary travel company that needed a website with
virtual traveling options for their customers during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, I found the course to be very useful and gained
more confident in my ability to create high-quality UX
designs as a result.
