In late 2019, my friend Sam Gullman and I embarked on a collaborative journey to develop his board game project, The Presence. Sam focused on refining the game mechanics and overall game design, while I took on the challenge of creating a cohesive graphic design language for the entire game.

My contributions included designing an icon font and a decorative font, illustrating over 100 unique cards, and crafting visually engaging game boards. Additionally, I designed the wooden pawns, the plastic insert, and the gameâ€™s packaging to ensure a seamless and immersive experience for players. Together, we brought The Presence to life, merging innovative gameplay with a captivating aesthetic.

The Presence is a strategic horror-game, set in a place and time where candlelight was the only means to hold back the darkness and the things hiding within. Trust is at the core of the game, creating a feeling of overarching uncertainty and dread.

One player plays as the Presence, an entity with unknown intentions. It can be either good or evil, which means each game can be fully cooperative or one-versus-all. The others play as the Visitors, who will try to work together to uncover the dark history of the mansion while struggling with darkness, isolation and the constant haunting of the Presence.
