Face it! is a cooprativ board game, in which the players discribe a colour code to each other while only using their mimik. During the game the players have fun and learn more about eachothers individual colour perceptions.

This game was created during the university project „Gesellschaft spielen!“ (playing society!“) in partnership with Emma Brix and project support by Karin Schmidt-Ruhland, Martin Hensel.

„Face it!“ is a level based game. The goal is to get through all 12 levels as a team. Each round one of the players becomes the discriber, who is discribing a random colour to the rest of the team. With each level the colour code becomes longer and there for more difficult to solv. To win the game the team realy needs to be synchronised well in terms of understanding eachothers mimik.
