As the elected Chairperson of the Art Students of Gothenburg University Union (Konstkåren), I spent a year leading the organisation with dedication and creativity. My responsibilities included managing the union’s organisational needs, ensuring that it operated smoothly and effectively to support the student body. I represented the art students not only within the university but also in discussions with the City of Gothenburg and on a national level, advocating for their interests in student politics and higher education. 

In addition to my leadership and advocacy work, I embraced the opportunity to contribute creatively. I designed graphic materials and social media content that captured the spirit of the union and kept students informed and engaged. I also played a key role in organising significant events, including the much-anticipated art school Christmas market, which brought students together, showcased their talents, and fostered a sense of community and collaboration.

This experience allowed me to blend my organisational, representational, and creative skills, leaving a lasting impact on the student community I was honoured to serve.
