During my internship at Albert, I developed a DIY
game-making toy for children called the Analog Game
Engine. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 now have
the opportunity to craft and play their own video games
using paper, colored pencils, and stickers.

Each set comes with a cardboard tablet, three sticker
sheets, one Avatar making sheet, and a collectible Albert
minifigure.

During my internship at Albert, I gained more experience in
working with an already-established corporate design of a
company. I also gained a closer insight into professional
user testing and project planning.
