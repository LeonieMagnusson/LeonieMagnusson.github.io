During my internship at Albert, I developed a DIY game-making toy for children called the Analog Game Engine. This crafting project provides children aged 4 to 6 with the opportunity to create and play their own video games using paper, coloured pencils, and stickers.

I tested this product with six children, supported by the UX research team. For the purpose of testing, I developed a standardised test to measure the children's engagement during a structured playtesting workshop. These workshops were filmed and later analysed by me.

This experience gave me valuable insight into UX research, which I found very helpful for my design process.

Each Analog Game Engine set includes a cardboard tablet, three sticker sheets, one avatar-making sheet, and a collectible Albert minifigure.

In the first stage, the child crafts the game level by gluing different backgrounds together, colouring them with coloured pencils, and decorating them with stickers.

In the second stage, the child draws and decorates an avatar for the game, which is then attached to a paper strip.

In the third stage, the child plays their game. Ideally, this is done with the help of another person who pulls the paper background through the tablet to create the illusion of motion.

Alongside developing the Analog Game Engine, I also practised my 3D modeling skills through making 7 3D minifigures in blender.

During my internship at Albert, I gained valuable experience working within an established corporate design framework. Additionally, I gained deeper insights into professional user testing and project planning.
