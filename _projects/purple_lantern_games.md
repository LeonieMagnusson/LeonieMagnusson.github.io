In late 2019, my friend Sam Gullman and I embarked on an exciting journey with the creation of our board game, The Presence. Sam focused on game design, while I handled the graphic design and illustration. This collaboration ignited our shared passion for creative projects and led us to found our publishing company, Purple Lantern Games AB, in 2023.

With the decision to self-publish The Presence through crowdfunding, we dedicated much of 2023 and 2024 to building our brand and community. This included attending numerous fairs and conventions, as well as learning the intricacies of digital marketing. I gained valuable experience with Meta Ads, managing a campaign that significantly expanded our community and set the stage for our Kickstarter launch.

In February 2024, we successfully launched our Kickstarter campaign, raising SEK 1,465,687. This milestone marked the beginning of an intense year of collaboration with our Chinese manufacturer, multiple warehouses, distributors, and Hive, our pledge manager. Throughout this process, I was deeply involved in every visual and digital aspect of our work. I designed and managed our homepage and social media accounts, created the Kickstarter page, and produced the game trailer alongside all the ads for the campaign.

These experiences have not only honed my skills in graphic design, illustration, and marketing but also taught me the importance of community building and effective communication in bringing a creative vision to life. Working with Purple Lantern Games has been an incredible journey of creativity, collaboration, and growth.
