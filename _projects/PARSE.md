I worked as a frontend developer for PARSE, the University of Gothenburg's research journal, for three months.

One of my first tasks was to enhance the workflow for developing the website locally before making live changes. This involved creating comprehensive documentation, improving setup scripts, and significantly reducing the number of manual steps required, making the process more efficient and accessible. I also documented the connection between local development and the process for deploying changes to the live website, ensuring a clear and reliable workflow for the team.

To maintain high standards in the codebase, I developed scripts to perform essential checks on code before it could be pushed to GitHub. This helped minimise errors and ensured consistent quality. Additionally, I introduced a structured issue management system using GitHub, where tasks related to website maintenance and improvements were documented and tracked. This transparent approach made it easy to monitor progress, understand the purpose of changes, and ensure traceability by linking every code update to a specific task.

My work also included solving bugs in various parts of the website, cleaning up unused code to improve readability, and optimising the site's loading speed. I also added a cookie banner and a privacy policy to the website. A particularly rewarding project was developing a new solution for the Practitioners page, enabling individual pages for each practitioner to be easily created and navigated. This streamlined process now allows new practitioners to be added effortlessly, with their profiles automatically listed on the page.

I greatly enjoyed collaborating with the team and tackling the diverse challenges that came with the role. The problem-solving aspect often felt like detective work, and every day presented opportunities to learn something new. I made it a priority to document these learnings for the future, ensuring that the knowledge I gained would be available for both myself and those who came after me.
