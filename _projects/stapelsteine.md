Stapelsteine (stacking stones) is a sensory game for children aged 2 to 6, designed for one to three players. You can play against each other or work together to beat the game. The set contains 17 soft stones (made of fabric and filled with sand), four wooden cubes, and a pouch to store all the pieces. The cubes tell you what to build and how to build it. The more stones you stack, the more points you earn. Stapelsteine challenges your fine motor skills and provides fun for the whole family.

B.A. 4th semester, Sand, project support by Karin Schmidt-Ruhland and Stefanie Kretschmer
