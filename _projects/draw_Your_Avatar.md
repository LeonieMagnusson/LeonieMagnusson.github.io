The "Draw Your Game" project was my Master's thesis,
where I developed a workshop for children aged 4-8 to
design their own video games. In the workshops, the children
drew their own game avatars and a map for a racing
game. I then helped them to digitize their art and build their
one-player-racing game using Unity. You can play all the
children's games from the workshops on this website:

Later on, I further developed the workshop series so that
children and parents could do it at home without my
assistance. For this purpose, I created a coloring book
containing different 3D model UV-Maps for the children to
color, and an app to help them digitize their artwork, build,
and test their game.

    </div>

This coloring book helps children design their own video
games. The video games that can be built with this app are
classical single-player racing games, where the player
must complete a race within a certain amount of time
without driving off the road. The child can design their own
avatar and racing track in the coloring book, take a picture
of them with a smartphone or tablet, and further edit the
game in the "Draw Your Avatar" app.
During my Master's thesis, I developed my 3D modeling
and coding skills and gained valuable experience in
project planning, scientific research, and writing.
