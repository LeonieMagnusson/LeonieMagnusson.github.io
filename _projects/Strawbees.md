During my 5-month internship at the toy company Strawbees,
I was involved in a variety of tasks. I worked on their Black
Friday campaign, created social media content, made
instruction books for their products, and developed a
prototype for a magazine.

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/strawbees3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Throughout my time there, I gained valuable experience
collaborating with teams responsible for marketing, sales,
and the company's overall finances. During my internship I
was one of the two designers at Strawbees, therefore I had
the opportunity to contribute to almost all of the design
projects the company was working on at the time.

    </div>

My main task during my design Internship with Strawbees was making multiple small booklets and a magazine with building instruction, play activities and fun content for children.

    </div>

While working for Strawbees, I was involved in organizing,
filming, and editing their Black Friday campaign, which
was made for various social media platforms. Throughout
this project, I worked closely with the sales and marketing
team and gained valuable insights into social media
marketing strategies.

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/strawbees5.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

I was deeply involved in creating instructions for various Strawbees builds. Additionally, I designed a logo for Strawbees' new BioPP certificate, used on their packaging.
